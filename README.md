# Community_Tips_Reascript
A reascript used to draw creative tips from a spreadsheet that will be stored within your local machine.


Hi, thank you for downloading this Reascript! 

The idea behind this was to create something light and 'fun' that wouldn't require a mass install of other supporting environments. So, this script has been created using LUA, rather than Python or C-based languages. Also, the spreadsheet with the tips & tricks is contained within this repository and will copy to your local machine. Should you like, you can edit this to add your own tips and it'll only reflect on your copy. I researched keeping this in the cloud to keep refreshes exciting, but this would require the user (you!) to install further modules and so on.

So, here are the instructions to get this up and running (it's not a lot, I promise!)

1. Clone/download this repository (likely already done)
2. Open the file named "Community_Tips_Reascript.csv" and copy the full thing to your clipboard
3. Open Reaper, go to 'Actions' -> 'Show Actions List'.
4. Within the Actions List, go down to 


(Un-finished)
